# tic-tac-toe-game-console
This is my first game in a console application. Do not judge strictly, please. If you have any suggestions or indications of errors, please write: gora1511v@gmail.com . I think to add a game with Artificial Intelligence. After I do not see any prospects, I think to switch to another game.
# A bit about the game and the rules
The game is arranged in a console application. Instead of solid lines, hash signs are used. The first is always the cross. If entered incorrectly, the game simply ignores and asks for re-entry. I think to finish this game on artificial intelligence, if you can offer something else to add, then I'm glad to hear from you.
